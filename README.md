Make is a safe, secure, performant STS for distributed microservices.


# STS Workflows

## User Context
A JWT is generated by the STS that includes the user context from the users bearer token.

## User Context with Unique Audience 
A unique JWT is generated for each target service in this flow. The user context is passed from service to service through tokens issues by the STS and the audience is specific to the target service.

## Service Identity with Unique Audience
In this flow the service generates a certificate backed token that nests the STS token. This provides a security context that uniquely identifies the calling service and the user/external entity that initiated the workflow in a manner that is very difficult to forge.
